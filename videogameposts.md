Making of my first videogame

0) Problematics
My state at the beginning 
No knowledge about how to make a videogame, discover a jargon
Hours and hours of research

Progress and decisions
Hard to keep all features, not everything is doable and fast to do

Talk about videogame frameworks, which one I picked
Svelte + Tailwind for UI/game state
Indexeddb with Dexie
Tauri for desktop
Capacitor for mobile

1) Spell crafting

How it works, why such feature

2) The battle mechanics

Isometric map
=> everything has the same size, easier for strategy

Screen coordinates to world coordinates: projection
